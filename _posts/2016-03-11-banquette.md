I've always wanted a banquette on the boat.  Too many wild college parties had completely broken the couch.  The design includes a hinged back for storage behind the bench, a low bookshelf underneath, under bench lighting to easily read titles, and clean mid-century lines.  I started with the vertical sections.  I used 1/2" marine mahogany ply.  Cardboard strips and hot glue make good patterns for cutting the final pieces.

It's funny how often I find myself hanging off the boat for a little extra room.

He recess behind one back serves as a magazine rack.  The other back hinges open for lots of storage behind.  our coffee table rises to become a dining table.  In its lowered position it tucks perfectly under the seat lip for a little extra dance floor!
