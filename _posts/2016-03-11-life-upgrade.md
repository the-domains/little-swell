We lived for years without a washing machine. Our marina has a laundry room.  Having Louie changed that a bit.  Babies, it turns out, are messy.  So we bought a combined washer-dryer on Craigslist.  It's a vented unit, which is crucial on a boat with moist marine air.

The first thing we learned is that we were getting a bigger skylight. The unit was too large to fit through the aft berth door! So one weekend while Sam and Louie were out of town I cut a bigger hole.  Then my neighbors helped me lower it down through the newly enlarged skylight with ropes and pulleys.  These combined units are incredibly heavy.

Happy Sam with her new washer-dryer.

Late that night I finished off the skylight with new glass and aluminum trim.  Sweet!
