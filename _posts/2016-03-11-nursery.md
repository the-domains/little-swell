We realized one day that the v-berth would make a great room for the baby.  It was, at the time, the most neglected room on the boat.  So we went to work.  It turned out better than expected, and just in time for Louie's arrival.

The first thing to come down was the ratty old headliner.  We replaced it with burlap to match the saloon (yes, the main cabin is called a saloon).

After repainting the walls we chose a navy blue color for the flaking portholes and the ships wheel mirror.  Large kraken decals, a baby hammock and whale print pillows finished the job.
